        <p> National Educational Television (NET) was an American educational broadcast television network owned by the Ford Foundation and later co-owned by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It operated from May 16, 1954, to October 4, 1970, and was succeeded by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which has memberships with many television stations that were formerly part of NET.
            <br/> <br/>
        The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) provided funds for cataloging the NET collection, and as part of an on-going preservation effort with the Library of Congress, over 10,000 digitized television programs from the non-commercial TV stations and producers spanning 20 years from 1952 to 1972 have been contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.<p>
            <br/> <br/>
        In 2024, thanks to the efforts of kids around the country (with the exception of NYC), and with an investment from Marcus Lemonis, NET was rebooted and was stylized to fit the modern era. It is now known as the channel that is "First In Education Nationwide" - again, excluding NYC.
